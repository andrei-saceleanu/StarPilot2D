## Reinforcement learning agent plays a video game

### Technologies

- Gym
- PyGame
- StableBaselines


### Algorithms (TODO):

- DQN (Deep Q Network)

- SAC (Soft Actor Critic)

- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

### State representation

- dense, low-dimensional vector of manually selected distances, angles, positions, etc. relevant for the agent -> MlpPolicy

- frame buffer -> CnnPolicy
